# How It Works
The Anime Face Generator employs a Generative Adversarial Network, consisting of two main components:

Generator: This network generates new anime faces from random noise, gradually improving its output through training.

Discriminator: The discriminator network learns to distinguish between real anime faces and those generated by the generator.

During training, the generator and discriminator engage in a competitive process, with the generator striving to create increasingly convincing faces, while the discriminator aims to become better at distinguishing real from fake. This adversarial dynamic leads to the creation of high-quality anime faces.
